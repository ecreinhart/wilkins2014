They have risen on all the standard markers of success: in terms of occupational status, income and power. During the last decade, in particular, African Americans and Latinos have gained access to some of the most coveted positions in the US. Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Sonia Sotomayor and Barack Obama are notable examples of racial minorities who have occupied among the most powerful positions, not only in the US but also in the world.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nThese individuals are not simply exceptions; the social position of average racial minorities has also improved. College enrollment of Blacks, and Latinos has increase by 50% in the last 20 years (while enrollment of Whites has slightly declined). The annual income of minorities who graduate from college has also increased by more than 10% in the last decade (while the incomes of Whites has remained steady).<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\nAll of this suggests that Whites no longer occupy a position of privilege relative to other racial groups.
